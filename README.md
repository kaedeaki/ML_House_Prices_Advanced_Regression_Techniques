# ML_House_Prices_Advanced_Regression_Techniques  

**Name of project**: ML_House_Prices_Advanced_Regression_Techniques  
**Aim**: To predict the sale price with machine learning regression.  
**Language**: Python  
**Solution**: Used XG Boost, Deep Learning, SVR, Gradient Boost, Ada Boost, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, Decision Tree method. Analyzed which coefficients are significant for the price.   
**Results**: The regression model of cat boost explains about 90% of the variation in the data. The important features are OverallQual_log and GrLivArea_log which significantly impact the housing price.
